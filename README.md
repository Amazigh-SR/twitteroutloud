## Why - problem it solves

We all know that Twitter is an amazing source of information, whether it be news, jokes, or life updates. We, unfortunately, have to scroll and look at our screens to be able to enjoy our Twitter feeds...until now:

Twitter Out Loud (TOL) is a single-page React app that allows users to log in with a pre-existing Twitter account via Twitter OAuth. TOL reads your tweets aloud via custom implementation of the WebSpeech SpeechSynthesis API. TOL allows users to control the player with their voice by leveraging SpeechRecognition API.

Featuring responsive styling so you can use TOL on any device, with totally customizable voice attribute settings, we know that you're going to love using Twitter Out Loud.
